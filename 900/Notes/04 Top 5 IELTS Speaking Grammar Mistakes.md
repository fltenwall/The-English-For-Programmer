2.Make sentences and juggle them(make different phrases using different forms) with a lot of/some/a little / how much ?

#### Mistake 4

#### Mistake 5

Using will for the future - in the wrong plae!

So next year, if **I have** a chance to go, **I will visit** London.

**If + present simple, ... will + infinitive**

-**What if** it rains tomorrow ?

-**If it rains** tomorrow , I **will take** my umbrella!
