# 每周一起背10句 | week 08
你好，我是英语专栏的编辑阿锦，欢迎来到第8期的“每周一起背10句”。

不知不觉，我们的课程已经进行了2个月啦，很快就要进入尾声了。本周我们主要学习了阅读和写作技巧相关的内容，比如paraphrase、金字塔原理。专栏已经过了大半，不知道学到现在你对英语学习有没有找到什么感觉呢？你可以在留言区说说你现在对于英语学习的感想，我们一起聊聊。

本周呢，我们没有读新的文章，主要侧重讲了一些方法，因此，我们今天来做一些练习。你来试着用paraphrase的两种技巧——词汇替换和句子结构调整，来改写一下下面这几段话，重点词汇我已经给你标注在里面了。快来试试吧！

**This one** seems to **make** sense – if engineers were creative, wouldn’t they have decided to be artists, writers, or some other " **Fine Arts" profession**? Wrong!

The key word in **being creative** is right there – to create! Engineers create products, services, and processes that influence people every day.

Whether **your work goes into** consumer applications, devices, or machines, the **end product** of engineering work is used by other people.

If engineers **suppressed** their creativity, they would **miss out on** a lot of **insights** into ways to solve problems than they otherwise would.

Every day, engineers need to find new ways to **think outside the box** to **tackle new challenges**.

They have the **fabulous** opportunity and responsibility of imagining ways in which the world could be different and then creating ways to make that happen.

That is **at the heart of** what creativity is all about and it should be **inspiring and exciting** for engineers.

For example, engineering innovations have been a big part of healthcare **improvement** over the years.

From data analysis to efficient software systems, to surgery machines, to providing treatment tracking and recommendations, engineering truly saves lives daily.
