# 每周一起背10句 | week 05
你好，我是英语专栏的编辑阿锦，欢迎来到第5期的“每周一起背10句”。

本周我们开始了第三篇语料的学习。我们讲了如何快速阅读，抓住文章大意。这件事说起来简单，真的要做到，还需要非常长时间的刻意练习。所以，一定要加油哦！

本周的文章本身非常贴合实际，句子长短也非常适合背诵，所以我把这几段直接放在这里。我们一起试着来开始背诵整段吧！

第一段：

For both employees and employers, remote work requires intentional design and implementation to be effective. People find remote work challenging because the established mindset says that being in an office is how work gets done. Remote workers also need to prioritize their mental health, by taking breaks, getting exercise, and having a social life. Despite the challenges, when remote work is done well, the advantages to employees and employer are sufficient to make it worthwhile.

无论对于雇员还是雇主，要想使远程工作有效，需要双方有心地设计和实施。人们感觉远程工作很有挑战性，是因为固有的思维模式都认为，去办公室上班才是完成工作的方式。远程工作者还需要通过休息、锻炼和社会生活，来优先保障他们的心理健康。尽管存在挑战，但只要安排得当，远程工作给雇员和雇主带来的好处都足以使其值得一试。

第二段：

The first starting point for remote employees is to have clear separation between home and work. This can be done through physical separation, by having a dedicated home office, or even working at a shared-work facility, such as Regus or WeWork. It is also helpful to have a transition point, something to replace a commute, that delineates the shift from being at home to being at work. Some people have found taking their dog for a walk, or simply going out the front door and coming in the back door of their house is enough to make the mental shift and start focusing on work.

员工在家远程工作，首先要把家和工作分开。要实现这一点，可以通过物理隔断，在家专设办公区或者干脆去共享工作空间（例如雷格斯或者WeWork等共创空间）。有时也可以人为设定一个取代通勤的转换点，作为从在家状态到工作状态的切换标志。有人发现，带狗出去散步，或者只是从前门出后门回，就足以使他们在心理上实现这种切换，并开始专注工作。

第三段：

Successful remote work is not just up to the employees. Companies and managers must make extra effort to exhibit transparency and establish trust, because you don’t have benefits of casual conversation and body language like you would working in the same location. Psychological safety is needed for remote working, and this means managers must be prepared to be vulnerable. Once a manager shows they are comfortable sharing something difficult, then employees will be more comfortable reciprocating. Humble said, “You have to fundamentally trust people because you can’t see what they do. They have to tell you.”

远程工作的成功不仅仅取决于员工。公司和管理者们必须做出额外的努力来展示透明度和建立信任，因为不在同一屋檐下共事，就无法享受轻松面谈和肢体语言的便利。远程工作需要心理安全感，这意味着经理们必须做好准备展现自己的脆弱一面。如果管理者乐于分享自己的难处，那么员工也就会乐于敞开心扉。亨堡说：“你必须完全信任他人，因为你看不到他们在做什么，必须由他们告诉你才行。”
