#### What ChatGPT is good at?

ChatGPT is good at generating answers to questions(not searching).

The answer is similar to that of a natural person. It's hard to tell the difference.


####  State of AI

In the past decade, AI has made huge breakthroughs in the field  of perception.

Since the birth of ChatGPT, AI has also made a huge breakthrough in the filed of cognition.


#### What ChatGPT is not good at?

ChatGPT is not responsible for the correctness of the generated results.

Sometimes incorrect answers are generated for factual questions - the questions or logic that have strictly correct answers.

#### The impact of ChatGPT on social development. ChatGPT is a powerful AI tool. How to use ChatGPT?

How to take advantage?

Using ChatGPT as a base, it is applied to special fields: for example, legal counsel, strategic planning, financial analysis, market forecasting, intelligent manufacturing, engineering fields, etc.

How to avoid harm?

Error-sensitive fileds should be used with caution. ChatGPT is only responsilbe for generation, not for correctness.

#### ChatGPT should be used with caution in error-sensitive areas.

ChatGPT is indeed an exciting technology, its emergence makes the application  of NLP more widely, and brings new hope for the development of AGI.

However, as pointed out, ChatGPT, like other generative models, still has some limitations in accuracy and reliability, especially in tasks areas that require high  accuracy, such as medical diagnosis and legal decision-making.

Therefore, in these areas, we need to use ChatGPT as a tool, rather than  a  separate decision maker, and always maintain the judicious use and human  supervision of the results it generates.

By taking full advantage of ChatGPT's strengths, and adding human supervison when necessary, we can maximize its potential and ensure its positive impcat on human life  and work.
